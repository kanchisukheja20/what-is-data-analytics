Data cleaning means preparing raw data so it is accurate, consistent, and usable.
Most real-world data contains errors, missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats, which can lead to wrong analysis if not fixed.

The purpose of data cleaning is to make sure the data can be trusted before analysis, reporting, or decision-making.

Main uses

Reliable analysis and reports

Correct business decisions

Better models and forecasts

Common tools

Excel – basic and small-scale cleaning

SQL – cleaning data stored in databases

Python (Pandas) – large, real-world datasets

Power BI / Tableau – light cleaning before reporting

In simple terms: clean data first, analyze later.
